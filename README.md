To run this game, you need python and pygame installed

1. First download both "main.py" and the "Assets" folder (For better organization put both folder inside of a root folderJ
2. Install pygame using 'pip install pygame' on the terminal
3. Navigate to the folder
4. Then run the game

Controls:
Left paddle - W (up), S (down)
Right paddle - Up arrow (up), down arrow (down)
